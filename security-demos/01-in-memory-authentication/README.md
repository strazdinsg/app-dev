# Security example #1: In-memory authentication

This is the first example in the series on Spring Security.

This example shows how we can configure:

1. Static users (with static BCrypt-hashed passwords)
2. Automatic Login form available at /login , and Logout form available at /logout
3. A simple "Hello world" page available only for authenticated users.

The code is based on the video
["How to configure Spring Security Authorization" by Java Brains](https://youtu.be/iyXne7dIn7U).
